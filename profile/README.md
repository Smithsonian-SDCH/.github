# SDCH - The Smithsonian Data and Compute Hub

The Smithsonian Data and Compute Hub (SDCH) is a browser-based computing platform that links sophisticated cloud computing resources with Smithsonian's massive archive of data.

SDCH is a vehicle for both research and education, particularly for learners in Smithsonian workshops and short-term (<6 months) interns in Smithsonian research units.

SDCH is developed and maintained by the [Smithsonian Data Science Lab](sidatasciencelab.github.io) in collaboration with [2i2c](https://2i2c.org), the International Interactive Computing Collaborative.  

If you are a Smithsonian intern or affiliated researcher and would like access to SDCH, please reach out to SI-SDCH@si.edu.
